## Setting up a basic cachin-only DNS Server using bind
Firstly install `bind` & `bind-utils` these 2 utilities are used to do DNS lookupp mainly `host` & `dig`
```
yum install bind bind-utils
```
Now make sure that the group owner of the config file `/etc/named.conf` is "named"

Now finds the IP address of your original Local DNS Server by checking `/etc/resolv.conf`

It should contain 
```
# Generated by NetworkManager
domain localdomain
search localdomain
nameserver 192.168.5.2
```
The IP we are intrested in is `192.168.5.2`

Now edit `/etc/named.conf`
```
listen-on port 53 { any; }; (Changed the thing inside the curly brackets to any)
allow-query { localhost; 192.168.137.0/24; }; (Change the IP Address to the subnet of the server)
forwarders { 192.168.137.2; }; (Change to the DNS server which is nameserver in /etc/resolve.conf)
```
