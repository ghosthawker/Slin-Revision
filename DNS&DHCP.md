## Setting up a basic cachin-only DNS Server using bind
Firstly install `bind` & `bind-utils` these 2 utilities are used to do DNS lookupp mainly `host` & `dig`
```
yum install bind bind-utils
```
Now make sure that the group owner of the config file `/etc/named.conf` is "named"

Now finds the IP address of your original Local DNS Server by checking `/etc/resolv.conf`

It should contain 
```
# Generated by NetworkManager
domain localdomain
search localdomain
nameserver 192.168.5.2
```
The IP we are intrested in is `192.168.5.2`

**Do Note that everything in `/etc/named.conf` is very sensitive meaning missing of `;` will cause everything to fail so check carefully**

Now edit `/etc/named.conf` on the `options` tab
```
listen-on port 53 { any; }; (Changed the thing inside the curly brackets to any)
allow-query { localhost; 192.168.137.0/24; }; (Change the IP Address to the subnet of the server)
forwarders { 192.168.5.2; }; (Change to the DNS server which is nameserver in /etc/resolve.conf)
```

As the original local DNS Server may not be able top support DNSSEC, disable the DNSSEC validation by changing the following lines
```
dnssec-enable no;
dnssec-validation	  no;
```
Now just start the named service and set it to be automatically started on bootup
```
systemctl start named
systemctl enable named
```
To check error logs in named service it is located in `/var/log/messages`
